# Floodlight
Battery powered, portable floodlight.

### Operation:
- Place a charged battery nearby
- Press F to turn on the light
- Use the mouse wheel to tilt it (15 degrees down to 60 degrees up)
- If the bulb breaks, buy new ones at Teimo's shop (300 mk)

The floodlight uses 0.1 battery charge per seconds and takes about 20 minutes to deplete a fully charged battery.  
The lightbulb has a limited lifespan, it burns out after 1-1.5 hours of continuous usage. You can buy new ones at Fleetari's (far left on the counter) or Teimo's (second shelf, right by the slot machine) for 300 mk. You won't actually get a lightbulb item, it'll be magically fixed. The new lightbulb gets a random health value, which ticks down by one every time the light flickers.

### Console command:
- `fl info`: display debug information
- `fl flicker [delay [duration]]`: display or set flicker timer and duration
- `fl health [number]`: display or set lightbulb health
- `fl help`: display this text
