# Some mods for My Summer Car
### Unflip your ride
A console command to deal with heavy vehicles that went tits-up. Kind of a cheat. Also kind of shit since it simply resets the car's rotation and places it 1m higher. It won't get you out of a ditch.

Usage: `unflip [number]`  
where `[number]` is one of the following:
- 0: Satsuma
- 1: Gifu (sewage truck)
- 2: Hayosiko (van)
- 3: Ruscko (rusty ventti reward)
- 4: Ferndale (Fleetari's muscle car)
- 5: Kekmet (tractor)
- 6: Trailer

If the command is called without arguments, it'll display the same list.

**Warning:** using this command will reset the car's rotation *instantaneously!* It might get damaged or stuck in the ground, especially the Gifu. Cargo will almost certainly be launched into low orbit. **Use at your own risk.**

### Item cleanup (WIP)
A console command that removes certain items (e.g. empty bottles, food) from the world to improve (?) performance.

#### Usage
1. Make sure the latest version of [MSCModLoader](https://github.com/piotrulos/MSCModLoader) is installed.
2. Download and extract the archive to MSC's `Mods` folder.

The in-game console can be opened using `~`.
